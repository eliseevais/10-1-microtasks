        What is Lorem Ipsum?
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
        dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
        galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
        sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
        with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
        versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        Why do we use it?
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by
        the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
        normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
        content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
        publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum
        as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
        uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
        have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
        purpose (injected humour and the like).


        Where does it come from?
        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
        making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
        professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
        the
        more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
        and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
        discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
        1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
        (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This
        book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
        the
        Renaissance.
        The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
        comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
